 * @property {object} 	config.shuffle_list							- When shuffled, gets populated with the songs the user provided in a random order.
 * @property {boolean} 	config.shuffle_on								- When on, gets set to true so when traversing through songs, AmplitudeJS knows whether or not to use the songs object or the shuffle_list
 * @property {number} 	config.shuffle_active_index 		- When shuffled, this index is used to let AmplitudeJS know where it's at when traversing.
 * @property {string}		config.default_album_art 				- The user can set default album art to be displayed if the song they set doesn't contain album art.

 * @property {boolean}	config.buffered									- How much of the song is buffered.
